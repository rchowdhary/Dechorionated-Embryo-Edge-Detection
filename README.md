# Dechorionated-Embryo-Edge-Detection

This is an algorithm where edge detection was applied to identify edges of dechorionated embryos of Drosophila fruit flies. Consequently, the figures indicate the results of the algorithm.

1. The 'First_Edge_Detection_Dechorionated_Embryo' figure indicates the boundary of the dechorionated embryo when edge detection was applied.
2. The 'First_Edge_Detection_Dechorionated_Embryo_No_Nub' figure indicates the boundary of the dechorionated embryo without its nub, when edge detection was applied.
3. The 'Germcell_Line_First_Edge_Detection_Dechorionated_Embryo' figure indicates the boundary of the dechorionated embryo germ cell line and surroundings when edge detection was applied.
4. The 'Rotated_Germcell_Line_Embryo_Box' figure indicates the boundary of the dechorionated embryo as well as 4 coordinates (specified as blue dots) that mark a box where its center indicate the possible location of where the centroid of the dechorionated embryo.
